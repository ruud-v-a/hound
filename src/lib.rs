//! Hound, a wav encoding and decoding library.
//!
//! Examples
//! ========
//!
//! The following example renders a 440 Hz sine wave, and stores it as as a
//! mono wav file with a sample rate of 44.1 kHz and 16 bits per sample.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::f32::consts::PI;
//! use std::i16;
//! use hound;
//!
//! let spec = hound::WavSpec {
//!     channels: 1,
//!     sample_rate: 44100,
//!     bits_per_sample: 16
//! };
//! let mut writer = hound::WavWriter::create("sine.wav", spec).unwrap();
//! for t in (0 .. 44100).map(|x| x as f32 / 44100.0) {
//!     let sample = (t * 440.0 * 2.0 * PI).sin();
//!     let amplitude = i16::MAX as f32;
//!     writer.write_sample((sample * amplitude) as i16).unwrap();
//! }
//! writer.finalize().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! The following example computes the root mean square (RMS) of an audio file
//! with at most 16 bits per sample.
//!
//! ```
//! use hound;
//!
//! let mut reader = hound::WavReader::open("testsamples/pop.wav").unwrap();
//! let sqr_sum = reader.samples::<i16>()
//!                     .fold(0.0, |sqr_sum, s| {
//!     let sample = s.unwrap() as f64;
//!     sqr_sum + sample * sample
//! });
//! println!("RMS is {}", (sqr_sum / reader.len() as f64).sqrt());
//! ```
